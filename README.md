# teensy-piano
Code to turn a thrift store keyboard to a USB device for use with the Renoise DAW.  In addition to having some keys function as a piano with the DAW, a joystick and buttons
were installed into the side to function as a mouse.

Wiring will change depending upon your keyboard.  In my case, signals were processed in groups of four as that is how it worked for mine.  The key is to match the wires to the ports on the Teensy and experiment a bit.
